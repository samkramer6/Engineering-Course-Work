# Engineering-Course-Work
Private repo for coursework at Virginia Tech

Contents:
  This repo will not get updated regularly and could depreciate quickly. For that matter take what is written within the code as a guide and not how to complete the assignment.
  The classes that are listed all have their respective course numbers in the titles of the folders. Only code is stored on this repo, that code can be a Simulink simulation or
  a MATLAB script. The course listing will be updated based on my own work that I have for each semester. I will add code for those as well. I have included a toolbox that has a
  number of functionst that I have written for myself. If you add them to your path in MATLAB then they will be useable in your own code.
