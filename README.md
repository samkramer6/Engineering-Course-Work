# Engineering-Course-Work
Private repo for coursework at Virginia Tech

Sharing rules:
  This repository has code and coursework from a majority of the classes that require code. Not all classes in the curriculum are listed. This repository is meant as an aid for 
  cadets within Band Company. Distribution is controlled by the moderator and sharing should be limited. While I have graduated from the university, the code here can still be 
  used to try those in the honor court, therefore do not copy any code that is listed here, this will result in a direct violation of the Honor Code.

Contents:
  This repo will not get updated regularly and could depreciate quickly. For that matter take what is written within the code as a guide and not how to complete the assignment.
  The classes that are listed all have their respective course numbers in the titles of the folders. Only code is stored on this repo, that code can be a Simulink simulation or
  a MATLAB script.
